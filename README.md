## About The Project
  
Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub) was readed in, cleaned up, and visualized. With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. Who is the most influencial in the development of this language and who are the experts were found.

The dataset includes the project history of [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.
  
 ### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
  
## Plots
The following are the plots generated to answer the following questions:
* Is the project still actively maintained?
  - To answer this will calculate the number of pull requests submitted each (calendar) month during the project's lifetime and plot the result
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile
